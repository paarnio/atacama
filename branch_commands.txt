Branches 
https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo

Branches are pretty easy to work with and will save you a lot of headaches, especially when working with multiple people. To create a branch and begin working in it, run these commands:

git branch mybranch
# Creates a new branch called "mybranch"
git checkout mybranch
# Makes "mybranch" the active branch

Alternatively, you can use the shortcut:

git checkout -b mybranch
# Creates a new branch called "mybranch" and makes it the active branch

To switch between branches, use git checkout.

git checkout master
# Makes "master" the active branch
git checkout mybranch
# Makes "mybranch" the active branch

Once you're finished working on your branch and are ready to combine it back into the master branch, use merge.

git checkout master
# Makes "master" the active branch
git merge mybranch
# Merges the commits from "mybranch" into "master"
git branch -d mybranch
# Deletes the "mybranch" branch

    Tip: When you switch between branches, the files that you work on (the "working copy") are updated to reflect the changes in the new branch. If you have changes you have not committed, git will ensure you do not lose them. Git is also very careful during merges and pulls to ensure you don't lose any changes. When in doubt, commit early and commit often.
